# kengi-showcase
fancy examples that exhibit how to use KENGI (game engine)

## Basic usage

First you need to install the [kengi game engine](https://github.com/gaudiatech/kengi) go there and checkout the source-code.

For better results (if you wish to improve the game engine) you can for example set up a virtual environment and use `kengi` in editable mode.

To do so, create a virtual env:
```
python -m venv .venv
```

Then, you can install `kengi` in editable mode by typing:
```
pip install --editable .
```
